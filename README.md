### Reflections and Comments
How did this go, overall? This did not go as easy as it looked. i think i like jss better. but this was my first time ever. 
What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far? cheatsheets. im not able to build quickly because i lack knocwledge of the terminology.
How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment? 2 days. as long is it doesnt carry on to the next week im ok with it
